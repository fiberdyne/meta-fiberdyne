Fiberdyne Yocto Layer Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial will guide you in setting up the meta-fiberdyne Yocto layer for the Poky build environment.
For all purposes, the Yocto root directory will be referred to as $WORK.

1. Clone the meta-fiberdyne repository into $WORK:

   cd $WORK
   git clone ssh://git@alpha.fiberdyne.com.au:20122/yocto/meta-fiberdyne.git

2. Locate your Yocto bblayers configuration file at $WORK/build/conf/bblayers.conf and ensure that the 
   following lines areadded to the BBLAYERS variable:

       ${TOPDIR}/../meta-fiberdyne

   Locate your Yocto local configuration file at $WORK/build/conf/local.conf and ensure that the following
   lines are added to the IMAGE_INSTALL_append variable:
    
       fd-dsp \

3. Once your image is built, there will be three new commands which can be readily used:
      
   fd-dsp      - Run the main DSP background application
   fd-dsp-ui   - Run the DSP GUI application (requires fd-dsp to be running)
   fd-dsp-test - Run an audio test (required fd-dsp to be running)
  

4. You will need to ensure that Qt5 is also present, and the Boost C++ libraries.
