+    Fiberdyne Yocto Layer    +
+-----------------------------+

* This Yocto layer builds in the Fiberdyne DSP code as a part of the linux image.

* Currently this layer only builds in the DSP library 'fd-dsplib' as a kernel module. The framework building in the application with this needs to be added in the future

* The recipe files are located at common/.

* During development, this metadata section wil be kept in this prebuild directory for version control. This would be contained in a tarball once finalized.
